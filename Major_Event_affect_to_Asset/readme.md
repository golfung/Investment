We cannot prevent unwanted events from happening, but we can prepare to cope with them. This is the basis for studying important events over the past 43 years, to understand how each event impacted asset prices and to use this information as a guide for investment allocation.

This project analyzes data in **Google Sheets** and creates a **dashboard** in **Tableau Public**
