# Stock data analysis (Part 1)

This is a project that a **finance job interviewer** asked me to do. He provided four sets of stock information, namely:

- Bid-Ask
- Tick matches
- ATO/ATC
- Financial Statement 10Y

I will explore the datasets to find interesting insights for investment purposes. I've divided the project into two parts. 

**In the first part**, I will analyze the datasets to develop trading ideas using my skills in 
- Data analysis
- Data visualization
- Trading ideas
- Python programming 
 
**In the second part**, I will experiment with different types of stock datasets to evaluate the practicality of the trading ideas from the first part, using my skills in 
- Backtesting
- Machine learning
- System trading
- Python programming

You can view the second part of the project at [insert link],

Here is the presentation for the first part.
